<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h2>General</h2>
<a name="What is Healthchecks?"></a>
<h2 class="rule">What is Healthchecks?</h2>
<p>
    Healthchecks is a monitoring tool for cron, Heroku Scheduler, or any periodic process.<br/>
    Healthchecks will notify you when your scheduled tasks don't run so you can investigate before it becomes a problem.

<h2 class="rule">Why would I need this?</h2>

<p>
    A stitch in time saves nine.<br/>
    Have you ever had a backup fail or an email campaign not go out?<br/>
    Healthchecks will tell you right away when something doesn't happen so you can fix it.
</p>
<a name="What is a check?"></a>
<h2 class="rule">What is a check?</h2>

<p>
    A check looks like this: <br/><div class="highlight"><pre>
    $ curl https://hc-kalii.herokuapp.com/ping/a3161eb8-368d-480b-aa22-1952dd85cac6.
    </pre></div><br/>
    It's a unique URL we create for you to add to jobs you want monitored.
</p>
<p>
    The response message is a simple <span class="api-path">200</span> and string <span class="api-path">OK</span>
</p>
<a name="How is this different?"></a>
 <h2 class="rule">Cron already sends me output. How is this different?
</h2>
<p>
    Receiving an email when cron is working can be helpful, but it's hard to tell when things don't run.<br/>
    The lack of an email in your inbox is hard to detect. <br/>
    Healthchecks solves this problem by sending you an email if your task hasn't checked in when it should.<br/>
    A second email notification will be sent once your task begins reporting again.
</p>
<a name="Which programming language?"></a>
<h2 class="rule">Which programming language can I use Healthchecks with?</h2>
<p>
    Any language that can fetch a URL.
